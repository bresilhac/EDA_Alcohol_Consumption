# EDA_Alcohol_Consumption
## A description of alcohol consumption of people by country

This notebook is an example of an Exploratory Data Analysis of alcohol consumption habits around the world.
I utilized the drinks.csv data file from Kaggle. This data includes information on country, type of drink etc for people around the world.
After cleaning and preparing the data for study, I used a variety of algorithms to show the relationship between religion, geographical location and
alcohol consumption.

## What The Data Shows

The data shows that where one lives and even what religion one practices determines if, what type and how much alcohol one drinks.

The datafile used for the project can be found here in the repository.

I give full credit to MAMMAD ABBASLI on Kaggle for the basis of this study.
