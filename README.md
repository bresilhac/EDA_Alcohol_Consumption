# EDA_Alcohol_Consumption
## A description of alcohol consumption of people by country

This notebook is an EDA of alcohol consumption habits around the world.
I utilized the drinks.csv data file from Kaggle. This data includes information on country, type of drink etc for people around the world.
After cleaning and preparing the data for study, I used a variety of algorithms to show the relationship between religion, geographical location and
alcohol consumption.

I give full credit to MAMMAD ABBASLI on Kaggle for the basis of this study.
